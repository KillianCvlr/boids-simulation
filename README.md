# Boids-Simulation
A (On-going) cellular automata in c++  that use SDL2 for rendering

## Goal
Make message based automatas that commuicates between each others using messages depending on what they can perceive.

## Requirements
This project compiles using clang :
>sudo apt install clang

It also uses the sdl2 library :
>sudo apt install sdl2-dev

## Next steps : 
 - [] Flocking
 - [] Options when launching
 - [] Adding eating ressources 
 - [] Adding dying
 - [] Adding mating 
 - [] Adding Communication between BOIDS
